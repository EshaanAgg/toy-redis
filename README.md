This is my solution for the
[Build Your Own Redis Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis) by [Codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io/)!

In this challenge, I build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. We then subsequently expand the capacilities of the same via extensions like:
- Replication
- Persistence and RDB formats
- Streaming

All of the implementations are based on the actual Redis protocols and thus are 100% compliant with the same. 

To find a detailed descirption of the capacilities of this Redis implementation, head over to the [Codecrafters' course](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/overview)!
